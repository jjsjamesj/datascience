This is the code book for the tidy dataset. There are 181 observations of 81 variables.
Variable 1 indicates which subject performed the activity. Variable 2 incidicates the 
activity performed by the subject. Variables 3:81 are the averages of the mean and standard 
deviation measurements in the merged dataset of X_test and X_train.'subj_act_avg' is prepended 
to each varialbe name to helpfully describethe fact that the variable is the average of all 
measurements for the subject and activity indicated in the rows. The averages were computed 
using the colMeans function.
